# GridWorld_DDChallenge

## first challenge

Create a policy that takes the arrow to the green square (No RL required yet)

# Virtual environment instructions

I recommend you to create a virtual environment and this can be done by running
#TODO how to install it

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

to understand the challenge better let's first understand the first environment. run:

```bash
python .\venv\Lib\site-packages\minigrid\manual_control.py --env MiniGrid-Empty-16x16-v0
```

to have a manual control over the environment
